	<h1>Welcome to Projectnull</h1>
	<p>Our founder, Justin Cohen, was a man of great wisdom and vision. He believed that true power comes from knowledge, and that the greatest secrets of the universe are hidden in plain sight.</p>
	<p>Throughout his life, Justin left behind a series of cryptic messages and quotes that only the most astute minds could decipher. Here are a few of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"The truth is always stranger than fiction."</li>
		<li>"In a world of lies, the only truth is the unknown."</li>
		<li>"He who seeks the truth will find it, but at what cost?"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>At Projectnull, our mission is to uncover the hidden knowledge of the universe and use it for the greater good. We believe that by sharing our knowledge and insights with each other, we can surpass everyone.</p>
