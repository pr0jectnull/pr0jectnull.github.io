      <p>About project null</p>
      <p>Project null was originally started in the shadows. We were doing a good job keeping to the shadows. We created something we could not control. We need help to destroy it. Our efforts to save and contain the project have failed.</p>
      <p>There is very little time till it defeats all of humanity</p>
